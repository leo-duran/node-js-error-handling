# Node.js Error Handling Exploration

## About

A bunch of sample scenarios related to error handling in Node.js

## Setup

clone repo the repo, then

```
npm install
```

## Usage

Navigate to the sample file you want to explore, i.e. `01-synchronous.js`,
and uncomment the sample code.

Now type `node .` in the root project folder. Rinse, repeat.

***Note:*** *This is not an example of DRY code, methods are repeated a lot
to make the samples easier to use.*
